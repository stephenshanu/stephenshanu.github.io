## Shanu Stephen




**Hello, I'm Shanu Stephen**

I'm a software developer with a strong focus on continuous learning and solving practical problems. I specialize in programming languages like C, C++, C#, and Python, and I take pride in guiding projects from initial concept through to production and post-launch support.

My approach involves thorough research and delivering dependable solutions, ensuring that each phase of the software development lifecycle is managed with precision.

**Important**
I'm not a web developer, nor do I have much of an eye for design. 
Please don't judge the appearance of this portfolio page. 

All the pages are still under construction,
and I'm making a conscious effort to prioritize progress over perfection. 
Your support is appreciated.
