**Important**
I'm not a web developer, nor do I have much of an eye for design. 
Please don't judge the appearance of this portfolio page. 

All the pages are still under construction,
and I'm making a conscious effort to prioritize progress over perfection. 
Your support is appreciated.

But my interests are always in bringing the value by creating the software.
I always see software as a means to deliver some product or service aka value.
Business provides product or service and software is just one of the component in the bigger product or service.
There are also the intangibles like Sales, Marketing.

Not all problems need to be solved. Sometimes problems can be solved by rethinking the problem
