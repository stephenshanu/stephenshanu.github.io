## Shanu Stephen


My name is Shanu Stephen and I am a senior software developer. I have been working with software for over 17 years. 
I have worked on various products from ideation all the way to getting the product delivered to the market.
I am a polyglot and have worked on C, C++, C# and Python.

I am not a web developer neither do I possess an aesthetic sense. So please do not judge the appearance of this portfolio page.

But my interests are always in bringing the value by creating the software.
I always see software as a means to deliver some product or service aka value.
Business provides product or service and software is just one of the component in the bigger product or service.
There are also the intangibles like Sales, Marketing.

Not all problems need to be solved. Sometimes problems can be solved by rethinking the problem
