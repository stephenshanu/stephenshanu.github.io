Hello all,

My name is Shanu Stephen and I am a senior software developer. I have been working with softwre for over 17 years. 
I have worked on various products from ideation all the way to getting the product delivered to the market.
I am a polyglot and have worked on C, C++, C# and Python.

But my interests are always in bringing the value by creating the software.
